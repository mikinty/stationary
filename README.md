# Stationary I Use

Even with the advent of digital tools, it's nice and human to use physical stationary tools once in a while.

## Pens

- [Uni-ball Signo Um-151 Gel Ink Pen](https://amzn.to/3yptYUp): Smooth, fine, and great consistency.
- [PARKER Sonnet Ballpoint Pen](https://amzn.to/3ySkMcz): It's a heavy but feels very good. I used to do math with this pen when I was unmotivated.

## Paper

- [Moleskine Classic Notebook](https://amzn.to/3nQzc6M): Love this book. Pages feel and look great, prevent bleeding for most pens, and the size is perfect. I like to use this for notes and journaling.

## Eraser

- [Pentel Hi-Polymer Block Eraser](https://amzn.to/3IpNkx7): This eraser is so good and changed my life in school after I started using it. Clean and strong eraser.
